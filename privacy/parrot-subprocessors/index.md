# Parrot subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Parrot (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../regulations/index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Cloud services provider.
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/resource-center/). Cloud services provider.
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/gdpr/). Cloud services provider.
- [Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/03/14/gdpr-sentry-and-you). Error reporting software.
